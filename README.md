Reference Style Guide
-------------
This project is a reference for developing a live, semantic style guide.  You can see screengrabs of what it looks like under the screengrabs/ folder.


To do
-------------
* Label things on the forms page
* Do as much spacing/padding/margins in containers as possible (no padding/margins elsewhere)
* Annotate this with more usage guidelines
